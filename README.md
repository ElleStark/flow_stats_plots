# flow_stats_plots
Compute and generate figures for select flowfield statistics 

Currently included statistics are:  
-mean u   
-mean v  
-integral time scales: u & v  
-integral length scales: u & v, streamwise & cross-stream  
-turbulence intensity  
-turbulence isotropy  

Note: u is x-direction (streamwise) velocity and v is y-direction (cross-stream) velocity
